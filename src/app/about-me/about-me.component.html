        I am a Front-end developer based in Munich, Germany. I enjoy helping
        designers and companies bring their ideas into real life. I am looking
        forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
        developer position. My ability to solve complex problems and my passion
        for programming make me a valuable member for your team. <br /><br />If
        you think I'd be a good match for your projects, contact me!
